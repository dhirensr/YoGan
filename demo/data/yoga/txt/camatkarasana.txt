From Downward-Facing Dog or Adho Mukha Śvānāsana pose, elevate one leg toward the sky and stack the corresponding hip over the other hip.  Bring the upper heel as close to the buttocks as possible.  The hips remain stacked; then bring the shoulders forward slowly over the hands.  Replace the corresponding hand to the upraised leg with the other hand and flip yourself over and extend the top hand forward.  The bottom foot is now facing toward the front of the mat and you remain on the ball of the top foot and the corresponding knee is bent.  Continue to lift hips up toward the sky and continue reaching the free hand toward the front of the room and slightly downwards.  Allow the head to curl back.
