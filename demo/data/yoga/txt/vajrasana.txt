Begin kneeling on the floor with your hips over your knees.  Place your inner knees together and your thighs perpendicular to the floor.  Un-tuck your toes and press the tops of your feet into the ground.  Sit on your heels by resting your glutes on the soles of your feet.  Keep your feet directly in line with your shins.  Your feet and thighs should be touching throughout the pose.  Sit up straight and draw your shoulder blades firmly against your back ribs.  Widen across your collarbone and drop your shoulders away from your ears.  Sit up tall and lengthen your tailbone toward the floor.  Allow your arms to relax and rest your palms on your thighs.  Soften your gaze.
