From a standing position, the upper body is lifted up halfway with the feet rooted into the earth and the toes actively lifted.  The spine is straight.  The ribcage is lifted and connected to the thighs.  The neck is a natural extension of the spine.  The fingertips are next to the toes.  The gaze is down and slightly forward.
