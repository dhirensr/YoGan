From a standing position the weight of the body is distributed equally between the front and back leg.  The legs are in a wide stance, parallel and scissor toward each other.  The back foot is at a 45 to 60 degree angle and the front and back heels are aligned.  The forward thigh is turned outward so that the center of the kneecap is in line with the center of the ankle.  The torso opens toward the sky while the hips are squared as much as possible.  The top hand extends up while the bottom hand is either on the earth (inside or outside the foot) or, if flexibility is limited, on a block positioned against the inner sole of the foot.  From the center of the back, between the shoulder blades, the arms press away from the torso.  Beginning students should keep their head in a neutral position and look forward or turn the gaze toward the earth.  More experienced students can turn the head and gaze up at the top thumb as a Drishti point.
