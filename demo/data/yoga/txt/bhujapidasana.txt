Come into Garland or Mālāsana pose.  Take your arms through your legs and place your palms flat on the floor behind your ankles.  You may need to slightly lift up your hips to get there.  Fingers face forward.  Work your upper arm as high up under your knees as possible.  Bend your elbows to create a shelf.  Hinge forward onto your palms until your feet begin to lift off.  Press firmly into the earth as you play with lifting one foot, then the other.  If available, lift both feet and cross your ankles.
