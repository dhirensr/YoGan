Sit on the floor with your torso upright and your legs wide.  Bend one knee and snug the heel into the opposite groin of your extended leg.  Lift your arms up overhead then take a side bend stretch toward your extended leg.  Try to press your bottom shoulder against the inside of your extended knee.  When your knee is straight, twist your torso toward the sky.  Lift your opposite arm up, lean back slightly, and then, sweep it behind your ear and take hold of the outside edge of your extended foot.  Press your elbows away from each other, using them like a crank to help twist your upper torso further.  Turn your head to look at the sky.
