Begin in Box (Cakravākāsana).  Lift one leg in the air.  Curl your toes of the grounded leg.  Bend your elbows into a strong, narrow push-up position.  Drop your chin, the front of your shoulders and chest to the ground and begin to straighten your bottom leg to send your hips higher at the same time.  Lift off by taking a tiny hop with your bottom leg.  As your bottom leg lifts to meet the top, bring both straight legs together in the air and squeeze your thighs together.  Keep a small arch in your back.
