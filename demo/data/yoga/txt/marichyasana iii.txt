Begin in Staff (Daṇḍāsana).  Bend one knee in toward your chest and place your foot on the floor, with your heel as close to the same side sitting bone as possible.  Your inner thigh and torso should be close.  Keep the opposite leg extended and rotated slightly inward by grounding the head of your thighbone into the floor.  Flex the foot of your activated, extended leg.  Extend the arm of your same side extended leg high into the sky and begin to twist it to the outside of your bent knee.  Use your opposite hand as leverage to twist deeper.  Hook your elbow to the outside of your thigh and gaze over your back shoulder.  If you want to extend your twist deeper, wrap your arm around the shin of your bent knee and sweep your opposite arm around to meet it.  Catch opposite fingertips or the wrist.  Keep a long spine.
