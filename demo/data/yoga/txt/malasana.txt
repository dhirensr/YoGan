From a squatting position the feet are as close together as possible (keep your heels on the floor if you can; otherwise, support them on a folded mat).  The thighs are slightly wider than the torso.  The torso is leaning gently forward and tucked snugly between the thighs.  The elbows are pressed against the inner knees and the palms are together in Anjali Mudra (Salutation Seal).  The knees resist the elbows to help lengthen the front torso.  The gaze is soft and forward.
