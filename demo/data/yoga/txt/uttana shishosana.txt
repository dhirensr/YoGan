The body is prone to the earth and the forehead, chest and/or chin rest on the earth with the arms extended out in front pressing downward for a deeper stretch.  The hips are at a 90-degree angle to the knees and pulling back toward the heels.  The shins and the top of the feet are extended and firm on the earth.  (A blanket can be used under the chin to relax the neck if needed).  There is a slight curve in the lower back and the gaze is forward.
