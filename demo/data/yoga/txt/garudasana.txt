From a standing position the one thigh is crossed over the other with the toes and/or the ankle hooked behind the lower calf.  The weight of the body is balanced on the standing foot.  The arms are crossed in front of the torso so that one arm is crossed above the other arm.  The top arm is tucked into the elbow crook of the bottom arm.  The hands are hooked around each other as well.  Once hooked, the elbows lift up and the fingers stretch toward the sky.  The gaze is soft and forward.
