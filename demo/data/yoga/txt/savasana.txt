The body rests on the earth in a supine position with the arms resting by the side body.  The palms are relaxed and open toward the sky.  The shoulder blades are pulled back, down and rolled under comfortably, resting evenly on the earth.  The legs are extended down and splayed open.  The heels are in and the toes flop out.  The eyes are closed.  Everything is relaxed.  The gaze is inward.
