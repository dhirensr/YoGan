From a standing position, one leg is rooted and perpendicular to the earth while the other leg is raised, extended back and parallel to the earth.  The head of the thighbone of the standing leg presses back toward the heel and is actively rooted into the earth.  The arms and the extended leg lengthen in opposing directions with Bandhas engaged.  The hips are squared and the tailbone presses firmly into the pelvis.  The arms, torso, and extended raised leg should be positioned relatively parallel to the floor.  The gaze is forward or down.
