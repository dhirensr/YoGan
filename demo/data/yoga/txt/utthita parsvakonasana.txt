From Warrior II (Vīrabhadrāsana II), the lower body stays static while the upper body is folded forward at the crease of the hip.  One arm is extended toward the front with the bicep by the ear and the fingers spread wide while the other reaches down to the earth on the inside of the thigh.  The upper torso and the gaze twist up toward the sky.
