From a supine position, the upper back is resting on the earth with the hips straight up toward the sky.  The torso is perpendicular to the earth.  The legs are fully extended and the toes are active.  The hands are either supporting the lower back or extended up by the side body in matchstick.  The neck is flat on the earth and the chin is tucked in.  The gaze is inward.
