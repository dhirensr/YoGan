In supine position, bend both knees and drop the knees to each side, opening the hips.  Bring the soles of the feet together and bring the heels as close to the groin as possible, keeping the knees close to the ground.  Bring the hands overhead and interlace the fingers.  Keep the back flat on the floor.
