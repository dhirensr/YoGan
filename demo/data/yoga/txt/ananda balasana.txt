From a supine position, on your back, the knees are bent slightly wider than the hips.  The ankles and shins track the knees in a 90-degree angle perpendicular to the earth.  The hands grip the inside sole of the flexed feet (if you have difficultly holding the feet loop a strap over each sole) and push the knees down, coaxing the thighs in toward the torso, lengthening the spine, releasing the tail bone toward the earth and extending the base of the skull away from the back of the neck.  The gaze is up toward the sky.
